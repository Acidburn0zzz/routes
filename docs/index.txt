Routes
++++++

Routes is a Python re-implementation of the `Rails routes system <http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/9>`_
for mapping URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's. Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URL's that are RESTful with little effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft (no big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down on repetitive typing.

Current features:

* Named Routes
* Sophisticated Route lookup and URL generation
* Wildcard path's before and after static parts
* Groupings syntax to allow flexible URL's to accommodate almost any need
* Extensive unit tests

Buzzword Compliance: *REST*, *DRY*

Routes 1.3.1 released with:


* Mapper has an optional attribute ``append_slash``. When set to ``True``, any URL's
  generated will have a slash appended to the end. 
* Fixed prefix option so that if the PATH_INFO is empty after prefix regexp, its set to
  '/' so the match proceeds ok.
* Fixed prefix bug that caused routes after the initial one to not see the proper url
  for matching. Caught by Jochen Kupperschmidt.
