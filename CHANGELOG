Routes Changelog
========================

1.1 (Jan. 13th, 2006)
----------------

*Backwards Incompatibilities*

* None


*New Features*

* Routes Mapper additions:
  - Now takes several optional arguments that determine how it will 
    generate the regexp's.
  - Can now hold a function for use when determining what the available
    controllers are. Comes with a default directory scanner
  - Given a directory for the default scanner or a function, the Mapper
    will now automatically run it to get the controller list when needed
* Syntax available for splitting routes to allow more complex route paths, such
  as ':controller/:(action)-:(id).html'
* Easier setup/integration with Routes per request. Setting the environ in a
  WSGI environ will run match, and setup everything needed for url_for/etc.



1.0.2 (Dec. 30th, 2005)
----------------

*Backwards Incompatibilities*

* None


*Bug Fixes*

* Routes where a default was present but None were filling in improper values.
* Passing a 0 would evaluate to None during generation, resulting in missing
  URL parts



1.0.1 (Dec. 18th, 2005)
-----------------------

*Backwards Incompatibilities*

* None


*New Features*

* Request Local Callable - You can now designate your own callable function that
  should then be used to store the request_config data. This is most useful for
  environments where its possible multiple requests might be running in a single
  thread. The callable should return a request specific object for attributes to
  be attached. See routes.__init__.py for more information.



1.0 (Nov. 21st, 2005)
---------------------

*Backwards Incompatibilities*

* None, however routes.__init__ will now load the common symbols most people will
  want to actually use.
  Thus, you can either:
       from routes import *
  Or:
       from routes import request_confg, Mapper
  The following names are available for importing from routes:
      request_config, Mapper, url_for, redirect_to

  
*New Features*

* Route Names - You can now name a route, which will save a copy of the defaults
  defined for later use by url_for or redirect_to. 
  Thus, a route and url_for looking like this:
       m.connect('home', controller='blog', action='splash')
       url_for(controller='blog', action='splash')   # => /home
  Can now be used with a name:
       m.connect('home_url','home', controller='blog', action='splash')
       url_for('home_url')  # => /home
  
  Additional keywords can still be added to url_for and will override defaults in
  the named route.
  
* Trailing / - Route recognition earlier failed on trailing slashes, not really a bug,
  not really a feature I guess. Anyways, trailing slashes are o.k. now as in the Rails
  version.
  
*Tests*

* redirect_to now has two sets of tests to ensure it works properly
